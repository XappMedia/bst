# This is the test file for your unit tests, feel free to copy and modify the template test 
# for your voice app as many times as you want. On this same folder you'll also find a testing.json 
# file, it contains global configurations for future test files you might create in the future.
# You'll also find a folder called locales, it contains the localization files for all your supported
# locales. Just put a value to each variable and they will be replaced here. Add, remove or modify 
# as necessary.
